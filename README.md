# GameZ Docs

## Loading GameZ

To load GameZ, use the script tag in your HTML:
```
<script src="https://pincescpu987.github.io/game-z/main.min.js"></script>
```
The source code can be found at [https://pincescpu987.github.io/game-z/main.js](https://pincescpu987.github.io/game-z/main.js)  
and the minified version at [https://pincescpu987.github.io/game-z/main.min.js](https://pincescpu987.github.io/game-z/main.min.js).

## Setting Up a New Game

GameZ is object-oriented. To start, create new ```Game``` and ```Screen``` objects, and ```Setup``` and ```Update``` functions, like this:

```
let game = new Game(60);
let screen = new Screen(640, 360);
async function Setup(game, screen){
  // This is executed once before the Update function.
  // Your starting setup code goes here...
}

function Update(game, screen){
  // This is executed once per frame.
  // Your repeating update code goes here...
}
game.startGame(screen);
```

Let's break this code down line by line.

```let game = new Game(60);```  
This line creates a new Game instance, required to start the game and also set the debug feature. The one parameter required is the FPS of the game.

```let screen = new Screen(640, 480);```  
This line creates a new Screen instance, required to create and access sprites in the game. The two parameters are for the width and height of the canvas created with the screen.

```async function Setup(game, screen){```  
This line creates an async function. Async is required only if you need to use one of several functions returning Promises with ```await```. This funcion uses ```game``` and ```screen``` references to work with sprites.

```function Update(game, screen){```  
The update function can be async, but **_the next frame will not wait for it_**. Async is only needed in the Setup function for loading files. This function also uses ```game``` and ```screen``` references to work with sprites.

Now, because you are using ```async``` functions, it may help to add something like this to your code, to accept and report errors:  
```
window.onunhandledrejection = function(errorEvent) {
  document.body.removeChild(document.querySelector('canvas')); // Remove the canvas to stop rendering.
	document.body.style.overflow = 'visible';
	if(_DEBUG){
    document.body.innerHTML = `<div style="margin: 10px;"><h1>ðŸ¤”</h1><h1>Hmmm...</h1><p>There's an error in your code.</p><p>Here it is:</p><p>${errorEvent.reason.stack.split('\n').join('<br>').split(' ').join('&nbsp;')}</p></div>`
	} else {
  	document.body.innerHTML = `<div style="margin: 10px;"><h1>ðŸ¤”</h1><h1>Hmmm...</h1><p>Something went wrong.</p></div>`
  }
}
```

This code tells the user something is wrong if debug is off, or tells the developer what is wrong if debug is on.  
Also, the code removes the canvas to prevent rendering of a broken game.  
The framework is based on the HTML Canvas element, so removing the canvas to stop rendering of the game is included in this snippet.   
However, you can write your error handling code however you want.

## Making a Sprite

To have motion, graphics, or even images, every game needs a sprite. You can't really have a game without sprites. To create a sprite, use the ```createSprite()``` method of ```screen``` object, with ```<name>``` being any string, like this:
```
screen.createSprite(<name>);
```

To access the sprite, just use ```getSprite()```, like this:
```
let mainSprite = screen.getSprite(<name>);
```
**Note**: You _can_ just repeatedly use ```screen.getSprite```, but assigning it to a variable is _recommended_.
**Also note**: If GameZ cannot find your sprite, it will throw an error.
